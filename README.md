Name of the project : Hotel Management System

In this project we worked with a team of our colleagues and wrote frontend & backend code
for building a 5 star hotel web application by using MEAN. In this project we have written codes that can perform
the basic operation like an amazing 5star hotel’s view, Booking hotel’s rooms. A user can sign in , sign up their
accounts and book hotel rooms . And by using MangoDB we store all the database of the person like email id ,mobile
number and all details etc.
